## Scene 0

A few days ago, you just arrived in Vietnam, in the buzzing Ho Chi Minh City (a.k.a. Saigon).

You are staying at the house of your overprotective uncle. Even though you are already [[15|25|35]], he's been treating you just like a child: driving you around, buying you food, worrying about you 24/7.

Tomorrow morning, you'll finally prove to him that you are not as helpless as a kitten. He will finally have to acknowledge that you are AN INDEPENDENT ADULT WHO KNOWS THEIR SH\*T.

The plan? Pretty simple: get a delicious breakfast, a cup of dark coffee (as adults drink), and basically surviving the morning all by yourself.
